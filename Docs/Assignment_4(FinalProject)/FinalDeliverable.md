In the final project, a few changes were made. One of the changes is that users can log in with their GitHub account, instead of their Twitter account. Login users can see their daily stock recommendations, based on their activities. Another change was that we weren't able to allow users to change the password as many times as they wish. We used the GitHub account for login, so they will be able to change their password through Github. We also weren't able to implement the profiles, where users could save recommendations or the components that would make the profile functional. 

In terms of the overall functionality of the web app. Users can search for stocks without login in. They can use the stock symbol or name associated with the stock. If they want to get a recommendation, based on their Twitter activity they need to log in with their GitHub account. It will provide daily recommendations based on their activities.
