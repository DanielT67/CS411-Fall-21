We started out by doing research on the Internet for popular environments used in projects similar to ours. 
This led us to consider Node and Django as potential candidates for our technology stack, which was based on our
research and also our previous experiences. We decided on Django because it is Python-based, and most members
of our team are very comfortable with Python. We also liked that generally, Django tends to offer better
performance and faster speed. Thus Django seemed like a better option for our fast-paced development.
