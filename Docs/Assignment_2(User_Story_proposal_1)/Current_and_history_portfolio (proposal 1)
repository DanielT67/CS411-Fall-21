• As a login user, I want to be able to see my stock history or the stocks I have available, so that I can keep track of my existing stocks.

◦ Description: The user story addresses the stock history or keeps track of the stocks users have available.This will help the user to keep
  track of their stocks, which may help in determining how many of which stocks to buy, as it relates to stock trends. The user will login
  to our app, and there will be a tab called “my current and history portfolio”. By clicking on this tab, the user can see the stocks he
  or she currently hold and the history of sell and buy. Our app will gather that information in two ways. Users can either associate 
  a trader account with us, or manually enter the portfolio.
