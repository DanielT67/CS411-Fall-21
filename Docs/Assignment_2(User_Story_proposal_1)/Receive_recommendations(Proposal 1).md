• As a general login user, I want to receive a daily recommendation of stocks so that I can have a better idea of which
 stocks I should invest in.
 
◦ Description: This user story addresses the recommendation feature of the app. Our users are interested in stocks,
  so our app can help our users by providing them recommendations that are suitable for their portfolio. Users will login
  to our app like the “Register_and_login” story describes. Then, users will find a tab called Stocks for today. By clicking it, 
  users will be able to see our daily recommendation of stocks, and some basic information about them. If users couldn’t see
  the recommended stocks, they should check Internet connection and refresh the page or check on 30 mins later. If the problem
  persists, our app will provide a tab for reporting errors.
