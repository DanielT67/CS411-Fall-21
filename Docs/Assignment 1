This is the proposal of what projects we are going to work on

** Proposal ** Idea 1: 
Use a social media API and a stock trade API to track user activity around certain stocks. Users will be tracked across the social media site (most likely twitter) and 
will have their activity recorded to record mentions of any publicly traded company. When a company is mentioned, its name will be recorded in a database. The more a 
company is mentioned, the more likely it is to be recommended as a stock pick.

Idea 2: 
Using Spotify API and a Google search API, recommend the user a cocktail based on the playlist they are currently listening too. For example, when a user listens to songs 
that are slower and have lyrics pertaining to break-ups, recommend a cocktail with a higher alcohol volume by weight. Additionally, if a user does not want to create their 
own cocktails, the API can be called to search up the nearest bar instead, and direct the user there.
