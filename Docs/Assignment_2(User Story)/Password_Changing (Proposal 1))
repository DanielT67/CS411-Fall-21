◦ Description: This user story addresses the password feature of the app. Given that we are dealing with financial
  information, it would be wise for the regularly changing passwords to prevent the possibility of them being hacked.
  In case the user forgets their password, they will be able to change their password, by verifying their email address
  or answering the security question. When verifying the email address, the app will send out a verification link via
  email to the user, which the user can click on, and it will redirect the back to the app. Once the user has clicked on
  the verification link and has been redirected, they will be asked if they want to change their password. Besides the 
  verification link, users also have a choice to update their password, in case they decide to change their password. 
  It can’t be the same as previous passwords. We keep track of previous passwords to help prevent password repetition.
