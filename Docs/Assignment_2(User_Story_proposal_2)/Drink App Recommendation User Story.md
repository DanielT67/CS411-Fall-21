## As a logged in user, I want the app to recommend me a cocktail for the currently playing playlist and to give me the recipe in the app
There should not be any links outside of the app, as this would disrupt the user experience. Any recipe that is scraped/given to them should be accessible in the app. The recipe should also relate to the playlist that is currently playing, for instance, becoming more sweet or a higher % content when the BPM of the song is slower.
